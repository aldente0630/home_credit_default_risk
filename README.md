# Automated Feature Engineering with *FeatureTools*
* The goal is to do automated feature engineering with [FeatureTools](https://www.featuretools.com).
* A dataset of Kaggle Competition, [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/overview/description) was downloaded for testing. The dataset consists of 4 tables, and the relationship diagram is as follows. Various derived variables could be created automatically using *FeatureTools*.
* I referenced [Will Koehrsen's post](https://towardsdatascience.com/automated-feature-engineering-in-python-99baf11cc219 ) and [his code on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/feature-engineering-using-feature-tools).
